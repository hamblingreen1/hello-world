# Overview

Hello world! This is a small program that prints the string "Hello World!" in scrolling text across the screen, written in C++.

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate a basic understanding of the C++ I/O library.

# Development Environment

I used the Vim text editor to write the code, and created a Makefile that automatically builds and runs the code using the commands `make build` and `make run`. I then used the g++ utility that comes pre-installed on my system to compile the C++ file into an executable.

The C++ programming language is lightweight, powerful, and used in a variety of applications including in embedded systems and RTOSes. I chose to use it for this Hello World program because it is a language that I'm already somewhat familiar with but want to grow my C++ skills further.
